# Approximate Bayesian Computation

This folder contains all the files you need to run a quick ABC sampler using [CosmoABC](http://cosmoabc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

In the [documentation](http://cosmoabc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) you will instalation instructions and a linear fit example. 

Once the CosmoABC is installed, you will need the following files

> 1. [user-input file](https://github.com/emilleishida/StatisticsInCosmology/blob/master/IV_ABC/user.input)
> 2. [functions file](https://github.com/emilleishida/StatisticsInCosmology/blob/master/IV_ABC/my_functions.py)


This will allow you to run the code in the command line. 

For development purpouse, it is perhaps easier to use the script shown [here](https://github.com/emilleishida/StatisticsInCosmology/blob/master/IV_ABC/cosmoabc_script.py) in order to use the functionalities of CosmoABC in environments like [iPython](https://ipython.org/install.html).

> This example contains a very simple straight line fit, but you can easily adapt it to more complex situations by customizing the files mentioned above.
