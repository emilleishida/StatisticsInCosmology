## Day 2 - Parameter Inference  

*“Everything we care about lies somewhere in the middle, where pattern and randomness interlace.”*  
J. Gleick, The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood (2011)

## Day 3 - Model Selection

*“Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do.”*  
C.S. Lewis - The Silver Chair (Chronicles of Narnia, #4, 1953)

> Information criterias  
> Cross-validation  
> Bayesian evidence
